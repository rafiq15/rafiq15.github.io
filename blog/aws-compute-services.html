        <h3>What is EC2?</h3>
       <p>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
        It allows you to run virtual servers, known as instances, on-demand. EC2 offers a variety of instance types,
        operating systems, and configurations to suit different workloads.</p>

        <h3>Key Features of AWS EC2</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Easily scale your compute resources up or down based on demand.</li>
            <li><strong>Variety of Instance Types:</strong> Choose from a wide range of instance types optimized for
                different use cases (e.g., compute-optimized, memory-optimized, storage-optimized).</li>
            <li><strong>Customizable Configurations:</strong> Select the operating system, storage options, and network
                settings that best fit your needs.</li>
            <li><strong>Security:</strong> Use security groups and key pairs to control access to your instances.</li>
            <li><strong>Integration with Other AWS Services:</strong> Seamlessly integrate EC2 with services like S3,
                RDS, and VPC for a complete cloud solution.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What is AWS Lambda?</h3>
        <p>AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers.
        With Lambda, you can execute your code in response to events, such as changes to data in an S3 bucket or updates to a DynamoDB table.</p>       
        <h3>Key Features of AWS Lambda</h3>
        <ul>    
            <li><strong>Serverless:</strong> No need to manage infrastructure; AWS handles the server management for you.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Event-Driven:</strong> Automatically trigger your code in response to events from various AWS
                services.</li>
            <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Lambda automatically scales your application by running code in response to
                each trigger.</li>
            <li><strong>Cost-Effective:</strong> Pay only for the compute time you consume, with no charge when your code
                is not running.</li>
            <li><strong>Supports Multiple Languages:</strong> Write your Lambda functions in languages such as Python,
                Node.js, Java, C#, and more.</li>   
        </ul>
