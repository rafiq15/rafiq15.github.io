        <h3>What is AWS IAM?</h3>
        <p>AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS
            resources. You can use IAM to manage users, groups, roles, and permissions to allow or deny access to AWS
            services and resources.</p>

        <strong>IAM controls:</strong>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Who can access AWS
            </li>
            <li> What actions they can perform</li>
            <li>
                Which resources they can access
            </li>            
        </ol>






        👉 IAM is global (not region-specific).
        <h3>Key Features of AWS IAM</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Users and Groups:</strong> Create individual users and group them to manage permissions
                collectively.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Roles:</strong> Define roles with specific permissions that can be assumed by users or services.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Policies:</strong> Use JSON-based policies to define permissions for users, groups, and roles.
            </li>
            <li><strong>MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication):</strong> Enhance security by requiring additional
                authentication
                factors.</li>
            <li><strong>Integration with AWS Services:</strong> Seamlessly integrate IAM with other AWS services for
                secure
                access control.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Best Practices for Using AWS IAM</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Least Privilege Principle:</strong> Grant only the permissions necessary for users to perform
                their
                tasks.</li>
            <li><strong>Regularly Review Permissions:</strong> Periodically audit and adjust permissions to ensure they
                are
                still appropriate.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Roles for Applications:</strong> Assign roles to applications instead of using long-term
                access
                keys.</li>
            <li><strong>Enable MFA:</strong> Require multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations and privileged
                users.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitor IAM Activity:</strong> Use AWS CloudTrail to log and monitor IAM activities for security
                auditing.</li>
        </ul>
