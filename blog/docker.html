            <h2>Introduction to Docker</h2>
            <p>Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications using containerization. It allows
                developers to package applications and all their dependencies into a standardized unit called a
                container.</p>
            <h2>What is Docker?</h2>
            <p>Docker is an open-source containerization platform.
                It allows you to package applications along with their dependencies, libraries, and configurations into
                containers.
                Containers are lightweight, portable, and consistent across different environments â€” development,
                testing, staging, and production.</p>
            <h2>Why use Docker?</h2>
            <p>Docker simplifies the process of application deployment, scaling, and management. It provides a
                consistent
                environment for applications, which helps eliminate the "it works on my machine" problem.</p>
            <h2>Getting Started with Docker</h2>
            <p>To start using Docker, you need to install Docker on your machine. You can download Docker Desktop for
                Windows or macOS, or install Docker Engine on Linux.</p>
