        <h2>What is Machine Learning model?</h2>
        <p>Machine Learning models are algorithms that learn patterns from data to make predictions or decisions without
            being explicitly programmed for specific tasks.</p>

        <h2>Introduction to LLM</h2>
        <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence designed to understand and generate
            human-like text. They are trained on vast amounts of text data and can perform a variety of language-related
            tasks.</p>

        <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Training Data:</strong> LLMs learn from diverse datasets, which include books, articles, and
                websites.</li>
            <li><strong>Tokenization:</strong> Text is broken down into smaller units called tokens, which can be words
                or subwords.</li>
            <li><strong>Context:</strong> LLMs consider the context of words in a sentence to generate coherent
                responses.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Applications</h2>
        <p>LLMs have numerous applications, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Chatbots and virtual assistants</li>
            <li>Content generation</li>
            <li>Language translation</li>
            <li>Sentiment analysis</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What is OLLAMA?</h2>
        <p>OLLAMA is an open-source project that simplifies the process of working with large language models (LLMs). It
            provides a user-friendly interface and tools for developers to integrate LLMs into their applications
            seamlessly.</p>
        <h2>Key Features of OLLAMA</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Easy Integration:</strong> OLLAMA offers simple APIs and SDKs for quick integration with
                existing
                applications.</li>
            <li><strong>Customizable Workflows:</strong> Developers can create tailored workflows to suit their specific
                needs.</li>
            <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> OLLAMA is designed to scale with your application, handling increased
                loads
                effortlessly.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Spring AI</h2>
        <p>Spring AI is a framework that simplifies the development of AI-powered applications. It provides a set of
            tools
            and libraries for building, training, and deploying machine learning models with ease.</p>
        <p>Spring AI is a Java framework that integrates LLMs into Spring Boot applications.</p>


        <h2>Generative AI vs LLMs</h2>
        <h4>Scope of Generative AI and LLM</h4>
        <p>
            The key difference between generative AI and LLM lies in their scope. <b>Generative AI:</b> Generative AI
            encompasses various types of models that can generate content beyond just textual data, including images or
            even music. Generative AI opens up possibilities for creating diverse forms of content beyond just text.
            <b>LLM:</b> LLMs excel at understanding language patterns for accurate predictions and textual generation.
            LLMs are
            specialized in understanding and generating human-like text based on patterns they have learned from
            training data.
