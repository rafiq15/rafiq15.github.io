        <h2>What is Machine Learning model?</h2>
        <p>Machine Learning models are algorithms that learn patterns from data to make predictions or decisions without
            being explicitly programmed for specific tasks.</p>

        <h2>Introduction to LLM</h2>
        <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence designed to understand and generate
            human-like text. They are trained on vast amounts of text data and can perform a variety of language-related
            tasks.</p>

        <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Training Data:</strong> LLMs learn from diverse datasets, which include books, articles, and
                websites.</li>
            <li><strong>Tokenization:</strong> Text is broken down into smaller units called tokens, which can be words
                or subwords.</li>
            <li><strong>Context:</strong> LLMs consider the context of words in a sentence to generate coherent
                responses.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Applications</h2>
        <p>LLMs have numerous applications, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Chatbots and virtual assistants</li>
            <li>Content generation</li>
            <li>Language translation</li>
            <li>Sentiment analysis</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What is OLLAMA?</h2>
        <p>OLLAMA is an open-source project that simplifies the process of working with large language models (LLMs). It
            provides a user-friendly interface and tools for developers to integrate LLMs into their applications
            seamlessly.</p>
        <h2>Key Features of OLLAMA</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Easy Integration:</strong> OLLAMA offers simple APIs and SDKs for quick integration with
                existing
                applications.</li>
            <li><strong>Customizable Workflows:</strong> Developers can create tailored workflows to suit their specific
                needs.</li>
            <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> OLLAMA is designed to scale with your application, handling increased
                loads
                effortlessly.</li>
        </ul>
